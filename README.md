# My Personal Notes on Git & Github

## 00. Preparation

```
git config --global user.name "Name Surname"
```

```
git config --global user.email "name.surname@domain.com"
```

## 01. Create a Repository

Assume that we have a project folder "MyApp" and we would like to create a repository.

In the folder "MyApp" run the following command:

```
git init
```
## 02. Add the page to the repository

```
git add index.html
git commit -m "First Commit"
```
## 03. Checking the status of the repository

```
git status
```

git status command is used to keep monitoring the states of both the working directory and the repository.

## 04. Making changes

Assume that you made some changes in the index.html file and would like to stage them.

## 05. Staging the changes
```
git add index.html
```
